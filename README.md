# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
A comprehensive Bank Customer Churn Analysis project using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, visualizations, correlation analysis, and business insights to identify factors influencing customer churn.
      Bank Customer Churn Analysis Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn 
       Project Overview 
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a bank's services. Retaining existing customers 
is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project analyzes customer data to 
identify patterns and factors contributing to customer churn. 
Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
and visualization to uncover actionable business insights.
